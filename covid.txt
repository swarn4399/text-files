The COVID‑19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is an ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19). The outbreak was first 
identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. The World Health Organization declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020 
and a pandemic on 11 March. As of 6 August 2020, more than 18.7 million cases of COVID‑19 have been reported in more than 188 countries and territories, resulting in 
more than 706,000 deaths; more than 11.3 million people have recovered.The virus is primarily spread between people during close contact,most often via small droplets 
produced by coughing,sneezing, and talking.The droplets usually fall to the ground or onto surfaces rather than travelling through air over long distances.However, the 
transmission may also occur through smaller droplets that are able to stay suspended in the air for longer periods of time in enclosed spaces, as typical for airborne 
diseases. Less commonly, people may become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their face.It is most contagious during the first three days 
after the onset of symptoms, although spread is possible before symptoms appear, and from people who do not show symptoms.Common symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, 
shortness of breath, and loss of sense of smell. Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.The time from exposure to onset of symptoms 
is typically around five days but may range from two to fourteen days.There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.Primary treatment is symptomatic and 
supportive therapy.Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, covering one's mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from other people, wearing a face mask 
in public settings, disinfecting surfaces, increasing ventilation and air filtration indoors, and monitoring and self-isolation for people who suspect they are infected.
Authorities worldwide have responded by implementing travel restrictions, lockdowns, workplace hazard controls, and facility closures in order to slow the spread of the 
disease. Many places have also worked to increase testing capacity and trace contacts of infected persons.The pandemic has caused global social and economic disruption, 
global famines affecting 265 million people.
