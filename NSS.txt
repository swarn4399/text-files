The Indian youth is accused of being impatient, indisciplined, disrespectful to the elders and irresponsible towards society and authority. It was felt that to curb these tendencies 
the youth required to be motivated in nation-building activities and made responsive to the social concerns.
For this purpose, National Service Scheme (NSS) was introduced in 1969. Its main aim was to involve the students of the colleges and +2 level on voluntary and selective basis in 
programmes of social services and developmental activities. Gradually it was adopted by all the states and union territories. Today it covers more than 5000 colleges all over the 
country. Under this scheme, rural and slum reconstruction, repair of roads, school buildings, ponds, tanks, plantation of trees, environment protection, health and family planning 
and education of adults and women are undertaken. The NSS students aid local authorities in implementing various relief and rehabilitation schemes. In the times of natural 
calamities like famines, floods, droughts, epidemics and earthquakes volunteers helped by NSS students play a very positive and constructive role. It instills in them the spirit 
of social service and the sense of responsibility.
The tribal youth are given vocational training under a special scheme to enable them to become self-employed. Then, there are youth hostels set up all over the country to provide 
cheap accommodation to the youth to inspire them into undertaking educational tours and excursions to visit the cultural and historic sites to revisit our glorious past. 446 Nehru 
Yuvak Kendras strewn around the country provide vocational training to non-student rural youth and improve their personality. ‘Bharat Scouts and Guides’ and ‘All India Boy Scouts 
Association’ are teaching Indian youth the importance of loyalty and goodwill for others under International scouting and guiding movement.
